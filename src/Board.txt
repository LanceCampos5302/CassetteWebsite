Notes on How Things Work

Cassette Side:
Size -> the size is set to 100% by 100% so each cassette side will need to be 
placed inside a div that is set to the wanted size, this allows us to have good 
control of the size while still keeping the ratio and not passing to many props  

Changes to project:
- Collections will be scrapped as of now 
Reason: the cassette logs in each cassettte work as a folder
